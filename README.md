# Redux Secret Keeper

Create an application that uses authentication.

* **Be sure to view the API docs for this project [HERE](https://github.com/twhitacre/simple-rails-auth/blob/master/README.md)**

* To get started you will need to use `create-react-app` to quickly scaffold a project. You should migrate your `components` into a components folder in the `src` directory and the styles into a `styles` folder in the `src` directory. Link up all pages to make sure they working and test `using npm run start` in the console, use Ctrl+c to exit.

* You will need use `npm install --save redux react-redux react-router-dom redux-thunk` in the terminal to save Redux, React Router, and Redux-Thunk your project dependencies and make it available for import.

* You will should also `npm install --save js-cookie`, `npm install --save superagent`, `npm install --save immutability-helper`. These extra library dependencies should be used in the same manner that the recent lessons have taught you to use them to help you achieve a working application.

* You may also want to look at **redux-form** and **reactstrap** as other options to help you with this project.

* You will need to create an application that completes the following tasks:

  * Allows a user to sign up, with a name, email, password, and secret.

  * This should send a token back from the server and stored as a cookie for future reference.

  * The user will then be able to login to the application and view the secret they posted, only if they are validated as the correct user.

  * The user should be able to log out of the application, thus destroying the cookie and requiring another login to the application to see the "secret" data.

  * If the user is not logged in or incorrectly tries to log in without a token, the screen should display that the user is not authorized for the content.

* The application will need to be styled and polished. Remember Bootstrap 4 for quick styling, or any other CSS scaffolding libraries out there.

* Again, the [API](https://github.com/twhitacre/simple-rails-auth/blob/master/README.md) you will use to sign up, login, store the secret message, and retrieve the message from can be viewed [HERE](https://github.com/twhitacre/simple-rails-auth/blob/master/README.md).

## Hard Mode:  

* Use `redux-form` to create a form that can be validated easily and meshes well with Redux.

* Correctly get the `logout` method to work and destroy the cookie.

Once complete, you should see the following functionality in your application:
